And you’re looking for evidence to confirm what you believe… which is that... you are... a spiritual being, and not just a physical one.\n\nIf you're anything like me, only an experience, your own experience, will be enough to take this from a belief, to a known.\n\nSome things in life require a direct experience, because words are just pale in comparison to the experience, and astral projection is one of those things.\n\nAnd I know it’s scary. That’s why you got mad at me. It’s an awakening, it’s a re-birth into eternal life, and it’s unknown.\n\nThis is not spiritual theory, this is spiritual practice. Astral virginity can be exciting, but it can also be nerve racking.\n\nAstral projection doesn’t just give you the means to remember that you’re a spiritual being. It means you get to visit your spiritual home in the Astral, while still incarnated here on earth.\n\nSubscribe to Todd's Channel for more free videos:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/toddacamesis?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nLearn more about Todd... \r\n\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/todd.acamesis \r\n\r\nTodd shares research and his experiences on his well-liked and followed Facebook page. \r\n\r\nSpiritual Underground: https://spiritualunderground.com \r\n\r\nHosted by Todd Acamesis, the founder of Spiritual Underground.

Although this guided meditation is aimed at beginners, its also suitable for more experienced explorers who desire to try something a little different.\n\nThe breathing exercise at the beginning of my guided meditations, are likely faster than what you're used to, which might cause light-headedness, the first few times you use them. If you do feel light-headed, just slow down or stop, just don't over do it. Most people struggle in the beginning, so just build up slowly, one day at a time. Also, faster breathing does not mean you're going to hyperventilate... typical hyperventilation happens when you exhale for longer than you inhale, causing uncontrolled, uneven breathing. Faster breathing styles have been practised safely for hundreds of years... from the ancient Tummo meditation, practised in Tibetan Buddhism, to the more modern day Wim Hoff method... both of which use controlled, even breathing patterns for increasing vital life force energy. \n\nThe breathing pattern in my guided meditations are one-second inhale and one-second exhale, which is comparable to research that reveals our breathing increases to between 15-30 breath cycles per minute, during our long est REM sleep cycles, which is dream related sleep. Its theorised that increased melatonin is being produced during this faster breathing stage, which probably plays a role in dream formation. Its further theorised that small amounts of DMT a.k.a. the spirit molecule, is also being produced due to the increased breathing... DMT is linked to transcendental states, and is produced in large quantities during near-death-experiences.\n\nIf this is all new to you, I suggest keeping an open mind to this new information, and be open to personal experimentation, because controlled breathing has been used for thousands of years by shamans and spiritual practitioners, to energise the subtle bodies for journeying, as well as, to achieve psychedelic-like states without using psychedelics.\n\nThis guided astral projection meditation is best used with the guidance I offer in this video: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/0Q5zoFtja7M \n\nIf you have any questions or get stuck, please post a reply on the pinned comment in the comment section and I'll answer as timely as I can, thanks. \n\nSubscribe to channel for more free videos: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/toddacamesis?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTodd's 2019 Recommended Astral Projection Gear\nPandoraStar astral projection meditation machine: https://www.pandorastar.co.uk\nEye mask: https://amzn.to/2HJ3zrD\nZero gravity lounge chair: https://amzn.to/2YRNANp\nMoon rocker: https://amzn.to/2QttLJz\nRed LED pen: https://amzn.to/2YUfKaO\nAstral projection journal: https://amzn.to/2MbDHZD\n\nFOLLOW TODD\nWebsite: https://www.obefrance.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/toddacamesis\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/toddacamesis\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/todd_acamesis","includedinjson":true,"channelId":"UCFQRGA3D28ScoS_47_jAObQ","channelname":"toddacamesis","archived":true,"faileddownload":null},{"videoid":"0b31se7BB8c","defaultAudioLanguage":"en","title":"ASTRAL PROJECTION Guided Meditation for BEGINNERS | 86-Minutes | 3.86Hz Isochronic Tone","publishedDate":"2019-03-10T04:14:59.000Z","channelTitle":"Todd Acamesis","tags":["astral projection","astral projection guided","astral projection music","astral projection experience","astral projection hypnosis","astral projection meditation","astral projection frequency","out of body"],"myComments_en":"","myComments_fr":"","description":"With voice over from experienced astral projection teacher, Todd Acamesis, this 90-minute guided astral projection meditation uses isochronic tones, guided visualisation, and energy work, to assist you with entering the necessary deep state of relaxation for astral projection.

These are shortened versions of the audios used in my 9-day astral projection retreats. The track includes some pretty interesting exercises for helping you develop your powers of visualisation as well as build mind-to-energy-body command and control, which is essential for developing your astral projection powers.

Shifting from the earth plane upon sleep, making jumps to the great Astral cities to visit loved ones living in the afterlife communities, to train in the esoteric learning schools, to rejuvenate in the ancient healing environments. Then returning to our bodies upon waking, feeling more grounded, alive and connected to something bigger. As we consciously strengthen the connection between our physical bodies and our astral bodies, the more we feel the energy of Who and What We Really Are - cutting deep into this level of reality...allowing us to release all fear of death and focus on living. This weekend, I took a big step in exploring beyond the earth plane with my own family as I trained my youngest daughter in the art of astral projection. Using the new techniques I'll be teaching at OBE FRANCE 2018 (www.obefrance.com), my 12-year old daughter was able to experience deep immersion in an altered state, where she experienced the vibrational state on her first attempt. No doubt the certainty she felt of having her experienced father and step-mother by her side, enabled her to achieve such a great first result. In the short 30-second video below, you can catch a glimpse of my new PandoraStar two lamp system that I've set up on F-DECK for the purpose of potentially stimulating the production of endogenous DMT. This two lamp system uses experimental software designed by my brilliant business parter, Jimi Simpson, that allows the lamps to exceed their normal upper limit of 200 Hz. The partition board enables me to work with both hemispheres of the brain independently. I'm hoping to release some lateralisation programs that can be used with the standard PandoraStar lamp and a simple eye patch in the near future. Enjoy the video...\n\nDiscover more about Todd Acamesis:\nwww.facebook.com/toddacamesis\nwww.spiritualunderground.com\nwww.obefrance.com","includedinjson":true,"channelId":"UCFQRGA3D28ScoS_47_jAObQ","channelname":"toddacamesis","archived":true,"faileddownload":null},{"videoid":"R79tKxJF7-o","defaultAudioLanguage":"en","title":"The Astral Planes and Your Spiritual Home","publishedDate":"2017-02-23T20:46:55.000Z","channelTitle":"Todd Acamesis","tags":["astral projection","todd acamesis","spiritual underground","pandorastar"],"myComments_en":"","myComments_fr":"","description":"Trailer for Todd Acamesis' Astral Projection Weekend Workshops in London, England...\n\nWhether you’re an absolute beginner at Astral Projection or an experienced explorer, this 2-day training and exploration workshop will give you all the necessary knowledge and tools you need for accessing your astral body, the Astral Planes – and the answers to your biggest questions about reality. \n\nhttp://www.astralprojection.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/todd.acamesis\nhttp://www.spiritualunderground.com","includedinjson":true,"channelId":"UCFQRGA3D28ScoS_47_jAObQ","channelname":"toddacamesis","archived":true,"faileddownload":null},{"videoid":"FBvmPHAJKMU","defaultAudioLanguage":"en","title":"OBE France 2016 Thursday Night Talk by Todd Acamesis","publishedDate":"2016-07-25T08:12:34.000Z","channelTitle":"Todd Acamesis","tags":["out of body experiences","astral projection","past lives","reincarnation","lucid dreaming"],"myComments_en":"","myComments_fr":"","description":"- filmed and produced by Andy Day, thanks to Alexandre Quaranta for additional sound recording\n- music \"Aquarium\" by Camille Saint-Saens","includedinjson":true,"channelId":"UCFQRGA3D28ScoS_47_jAObQ","channelname":"toddacamesis","archived":true,"faileddownload":null}]
