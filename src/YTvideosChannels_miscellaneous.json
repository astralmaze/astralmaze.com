In this video I talk about my feelings about how real or not it may be.\n\nMy  technique that I use:\n\nDuring the evening (about 6-9pm) I listen to different astral projection mp3's or I use youtube. One of my faves is Paul Santesie. (spelling?) This has never been successful for me, but I think it helps put it in my mind to project during the night. Another thing I do in the evening is listen to stuff to help open my 3rd eye. I have also switched to non-floride toothpaste as I heard it can clog up your 3rd eye. Anyway, make sure you get at least 5 good hours of sleep before trying during the night or you will just fall to sleep. After 5 hours or so I usually wake up naturally cause I have to go to the bathroom. It is then when I decide if I will try to project or just go back to sleep. If I decide to try I turn on a light, or do small odd jobs around the house - the idea is to make sure your mind is fully awake. After 15-30 minutes I go back to bed and turn off all the lights and then I lay there quietly and just let nature take its course. I think about projecting and I try to envision the white light of protection, but my goal at this point is not to go back to sleep, but rather just relax. After 15 minutes or so I usually find myself going in and out of consciousness, I try to \"center\" myself at this point. Eventually you will feel the vibrations and hear the rushing sounds - don't get too excited if you do it will stop, just relax and keep going. If you make it thru the vibrations and sounds and have not raised your mind frequency too much, it is at this point you can crawl out of your body. This is the way it works for me. Ive had about a dozen experiences since this video, but none yet that I am SURE that I was awake and not dreaming cause they often get weird right after separation. I look on each experience as a stepping stone to perfection. Once I have the next experience that I know wasn't a dream, I will post it. Hope this helps. Good luck. Keep in mind many many nights when I wake up at that point I just want to go back to sleep and often I do. You think different in the middle of the night than during the day. Often I scold myself in the morning cause I was too \"lazy\" to try it.","includedinjson":true,"channelId":"UCqFyyS4UB2arWAIX7x7VtYA","channelname":"miscellaneous","archived":null,"faileddownload":null},{"videoid":"_HJzxjehTHk","defaultAudioLanguage":"en","title":"My First Astral Projection Experience (AMAZING EXPERIENCE)","publishedDate":"2013-03-19T03:18:09.000Z","channelTitle":"Gordon Xavier","tags":["Astral","Projection","First","My","Lucid","Dreaming","Dream","Dreams","Ancient","Requiem","Prjojection","stories","experiences","Experience","(Quotation","Subject)","good","Astral Projection","Astral Travel","Sleep Paralysis","Shadow people","How to astral project","what is astral projection?","Astral Travel Experiences","Astral Projection Expereinces","first astral travel"],"myComments_en":"","myComments_fr":"","description":"My first astral projection experience was mind-blowing!

Usually the body houses the astral, but what the master explain here is to cover one's physical with the astral so  that the astral houses the physical. This way one enters into the 4th dimension.\n--------------------\n/Êó•Êú¨Ë™û/\nÔºªË®≥Ê≥®ÔºΩ\n\n*„ÄåÂπΩ‰Ωì„Äç„Å®„ÅØÊòüÊ∞ó‰Ωì„Éª„Ç¢„Çπ„Éà„É©„É´„Éú„Éá„Ç£„Éº„ÅÆ„Åì„Å®„Å†„ÄÇ\n* „ÄåÁúüË®Ä„Äç„Å®„ÅØ„Éû„É≥„Éà„É©„ÉªÂíí(„Åò„ÇÖ)„ÅÆ„Åì„Å®„Å†„ÄÇÂØÜÊïô„Å´Áî±Êù•„Åô„Çã„ÄÇ\n*„ÄÄÊòüÊ∞óÁïå„ÅØÁ¨¨ÔºïÊ¨°ÂÖÉ„Å®Ë®Ä„Çè„Çå„ÄÅÊòüÊ∞ó‰Ωì„ÅåËÇâ‰Ωì„ÇíË¶Ü„Å£„Åü„Çâ„ÄÅÁ¨¨ÔºîÊ¨°ÂÖÉ„Å´Êµ∏ÈÄè„Åô„Çã„ÄÇ„Åù„Çå„ÅßÊòüÊ∞ó‰Ωì„Åå„ÇÇ„Å£„Å®ÂÖ∑‰ΩìÁöÑ„Å´„Å™„Çä„ÄÅÂØæË±°Áâ©„ÇíÂãï„Åã„Åô„Åì„Å®„ÅåÂá∫Êù•„Åü„Çä„ÄÅËÇâÁúº„ÅßË¶ã„Åà„Åü„Çä„Åô„Çã„ÄÇ\n--------------------","includedinjson":true,"channelId":"UCi2hAgbXj-Lu1jjJsI5fS0w","channelname":"miscellaneous","archived":null,"faileddownload":null},{"videoid":"iKglrf2-co0","defaultAudioLanguage":"en","title":"How to Induce an Out-Of-Body Experience - Part 2 - Separation","publishedDate":"2009-07-12T14:12:44.000Z","channelTitle":"Bedeekin","tags":["astral","projection","NDE","Out","of","Body","Experience","dimensions","time","travel","OOBE","OBE","ghosts","spirituality","quantum","mind","DMT","direct methode"],"myComments_en":"","myComments_fr":"","description":"Visit my site that has a wiki of OOBEs and related phenomenon http://www.meta-mind.org/\r\nor go to http://astralviewers.com were I write regular posts and articles.\r\n\r\nAs promised, part 2... Separation.\r\n\r\nThere is so much more information to give regarding Separation. Too much for a Youtube video. \r\nHowever, the info in this video is enough regarding what you need to know right now.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things I should point out... I have said that in the 2nd Phase OOBE it's possible to visit other worlds, times and dead people... I can not know this for sure because of the subjective nature it.\r\n\r\nTo put it one way... the worlds visited seem to have rules of their own and don't change no matter how many times I visit them... they are consitent in nature. \r\n\r\nIn other words they seem to be independent realities. Still I can not rule out the fact that I may be creating them... if so, then I must be an imaginative genius who can conjure up other worlds... which is very highly unlikely. I am pretty normal.\r\n\r\nIf you are skeptical about the reality of these experiences, then I beg you to try these techniques so that you may experience OOBEs for yourself... after which you have a right to make valid comments...\r\n\r\nI have offered you a chance to try....\r\n\r\nIf you don't attempt experiencing an OOBE then save your unfounded opinion to yourself. \r\n\r\nAnyway... like I mentioned in the video, I will edit together another video explaining vision while Out of Body and control methods. Also, please don't hesitate to contact me if there's anything you don't understand or if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nBedeekin.","includedinjson":true,"channelId":"UCzJ1dolFZi8x7Y41gOnTtEA","channelname":"miscellaneous","archived":null,"faileddownload":null},{"videoid":"0-9hETPjJlo","defaultAudioLanguage":"en","title":"How to induce an Out Of Body Experience - part 1 - Sleep Paralysis","publishedDate":"2009-07-02T09:41:45.000Z","channelTitle":"Bedeekin","tags":["astral","projection","lucid","dreaming","out","of","body","experience","DMT","OOBE","OBE","remote","viewing","spirit","soul","NDEs","direct methode"],"myComments_en":"","myComments_fr":"","description":"Visit my website at http://www.meta-mind.org/\r\nGo to http://astralviewers.com where I regularly write articles.\r\nThis is the first video in a series of however many I need to make...\r\nIt will give you a very easy technique to induce an OOBE (Out-Of-Body Experience).\r\n\r\nThis first video deals with the most important aspect; inducing the gateway state needed to achieve a full blown OOBE which is what the medical establishment term 'Sleep Paralysis' amongst other things... I call it 'The Vibrational State'. \r\nI started having sleep paralysis at the age of 11... a very scary experience at first, but after a while I learned that I wasn't so paralysed; I seemed to be able to separate my consciousness from my physical body.\r\n\r\nThis is a no bullshit, non-new age way of inducing it... no meditation needed... no money to spend on a 4 week course... no rubbish about Chakras and no silly or useless audio tapes to listen to. \r\n\r\nIt's the only technique I have used for 25 years and the same technique I've taught, (or rather 'shown') to friends, family and online strangers - some of whom I have made good friends. It has a pretty much 100% hit rate for success... even if it doesn't it can be tweaked to fit different lifestyles. \r\n\r\nThe overall creepy ambience and imagery of the video actually serves the purpose of letting the uninitiated or anyone who has never experienced OOBEs or Sleep Paralysis to know what to expect. They are scary... Check out imanselmo's videos... he is pretty much on the ball with the fear factor: http://www.youtube.com/user/imanselmo\r\n\r\nThe noises and presence aren't demonic, evil or dangerous... learn to ignore them... I did at the age of 11 and I haven't come to any harm; If you average 3-4 OOBEs a week for 25 years... You do the math. All of these thousands of OOBEs have amounted to a good content for a book... Which I am writing. \r\n\r\nMaster the Vibrational State... endure it. Once you pass through the state into the OOBE... it's worth it. Trust me.\r\n\r\nOOBEs have become a massive influence on my life... I have grown up with them... it's my second life.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you progress!","includedinjson":true,"channelId":"UCzJ1dolFZi8x7Y41gOnTtEA","channelname":"miscellaneous","archived":null,"faileddownload":null}]
